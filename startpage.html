    <h2>Summary</h2>
    Hi there! I'm Evelyne, I have a masters degree in civil engineering-architecture
    and a long love of computer science. The combination of a science/design degree
    is a perfect foundation for application development. I'm a merciless refactorer
    and am eager to keep learning new languages and frameworks. Also a total package
    as a geek, from xkcd-jokes to every Doctor Who quote. Hope to meet you soon!
